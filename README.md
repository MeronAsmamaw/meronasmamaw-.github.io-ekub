 # How to make Equb using JavaScript?

 **Introduction**

Equb is an association of people in Ethiopian culture with the aim of mobilizing resources, especially finance, and distributing them on a rotating basis and there is a winner. so I’m going to show you how I did this using JavaScript.

Step 1.  create an index.html file in this I created a form which includes Full name, Amount and phone. So the members fill this form. 

Step 2. Create Add and Pick winner buttons. I created this buttons because when the members fill the form I want to display the form to the table so they click the add button and the pick winner button is used to select the winner randomly from the members.

Step 3. create table to display the data that is inserted from the form.

lets see the code that is used to make form with the button and tables

 # you can create your own Navigation using bootstrap or others
